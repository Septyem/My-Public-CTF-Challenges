# My Public CTF Challenges

This repo is for collecting all my non-trivial public CTF challenges, since I find they scatter at different positions now. And the format is partially inspired by [Law](https://github.com/l4wio/CTF-challenges-by-me).

For the `Flag Source` column I just record where I find the flag for this challenge, which is not related to the solutions and you can just ignore it.

Name | Event | Category | Difficulty | Comment | Flag Source
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
[zer0ssh](https://github.com/Septyem/0ctf_tctf_2019/tree/master/zer0ssh) | 0CTF/TCTF 2019 Finals | Crypto | Hard | The combination of one-time signature and docker image. Forge signatures for xmss by collecting enough samples. The solution is not hard to understand but you should deal with all these details in ssh authentication process | *[A Perfect Day for Bananafish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Perfect_Day_for_Bananafish)*
[babydb](https://github.com/Septyem/0ctf_tctf_2019/tree/master/babydb) | 0CTF/TCTF 2019 Finals | Web | Medium Easy | Key-value database web service written with ocaml-cohttp. Misuse of state monad | /
[babymath](https://github.com/Septyem/0ctf_tctf_2019/tree/master/babymath) | 0CTF/TCTF 2019 Finals | Reverse | Medium Easy | Discrete logrithm for matrix and baby-step giant-step | /
[notfeal](https://github.com/sixstars/starctf2019/tree/master/crypto-notfeal) | *ctf 2019 | Crypto | Medium | Differential cryptanalysis of modified FEAL. This challenge is not interesting enough but rather a good practice to get into cryptanalysis details | /
[babyprng](https://github.com/sixstars/starctf2019/tree/master/crypto-babyprng) | *ctf 2019 | Crypto | Easy | Basic von Neumann extractor (notice that babyprng2 credits to zzj, not me) | /
[zer0des](https://github.com/Septyem/0ctf_tctf_2019/tree/master/zer0des) | 0CTF/TCTF 2019 Quals | Crypto | Hard | Breaking 8-round DES with differential-linear cryptanalysis. You are supposed to find more differential paths yourself. Due to heavy traffic required in test, I did not use 9-round, which makes it easier to solve | *[The Brothers Karamazov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov)*
[zer0mi](https://github.com/Septyem/0ctf_tctf_2019/tree/master/zer0mi) | 0CTF/TCTF 2019 Quals | Crypto | Hard | Breaking Matsomoto-Imai cryptosystem by algebraic attack and solving linear equations | *Le Deuil des primev√®res*
[babysponge](https://github.com/Septyem/0ctf_tctf_2019/tree/master/babysponge) | 0CTF/TCTF 2019 Quals | Crypto | Medium Easy | Finding hash collisions by meet-in-the-middle attack for the sha-3 sponge construction with a extremely small capacity | *[Pale Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Fire)*
[If on a winters night a traveler](https://github.com/Septyem/0ctf_tctf_2019/tree/master/If_on_a_winter's_night_a_traveler) | 0CTF/TCTF 2019 Quals | Pwn | Medium | Pwning integer overflow in a customized encryption method for vim. I take the self-reference idea from Calvino | *[Miguel Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Street)*
[Proof of Work](https://github.com/Septyem/0ctf_tctf_2018/tree/master/Proof_of_Work) | 0CTF/TCTF 2018 Finals | Crypto | Hard | Implementing collision for MD5-like hash function with given prefix. As far as I know no one designed CTF challenges about MD5 collision internals before | *[The Garden of Forking Paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths)*
[ibe](https://github.com/Septyem/0ctf_tctf_2018/tree/master/ibe) | 0CTF/TCTF 2018 Finals | Crypto | Medium | Using identity-based encryption (Cocks IBE scheme) but the key point is utilizing discriminator in quadratic residue. The task is not very natural but in general the idea is not bad | /
[primitive](https://github.com/sixstars/starctf2018/tree/master/crypto-primitive) | *ctf 2018 | Crypto | Medium Hard | Building any given permutations with add, rotate, xor only. Since the number of operation is limited you should also optimize your construction | /
[ssss/ssss2](https://github.com/sixstars/starctf2018/tree/master/crypto-ssss-ssss2) | *ctf 2018 | Crypto | Medium | Xor key reuse issue for AES_CTR. And the scripts imitate the process of WPA2 which have state inconsistency issue and are vulnerable to KRACK-style attack. In fact I think this challenge is not concise enough | /
[yafu](https://github.com/sixstars/starctf2018/tree/master/misc-yafu) | *ctf 2018 | Misc | Medium | Logical bugs inside yafu and I just want to show how weak our daily crypto tools can be | /
[stackoverflow](https://github.com/sixstars/starctf2018/tree/master/pwn-stackoverflow) | *ctf 2018 | Pwn | Medium | Trivial stack overflow without special chars like `\x00` | /
[rsa](https://github.com/Septyem/starctf-2017/tree/master/rsa) | *ctf 2017 | Crypto | Easy | Factoring big integer using Pollard's rho algorithm | *[Memoirs of Hadrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_Hadrian)*
[sql](https://github.com/Septyem/starctf-2017/tree/master/sql) | *ctf 2017 | Reverse | Easy | Reversing SQLite3 bytecode and recover the sql query | /
[compCipher](https://github.com/Septyem/starctf-2017/tree/master/compCipher) | *ctf 2017 | Pwn/Crypto | Easy | This challenge is for beginners and has nothing special | / |
