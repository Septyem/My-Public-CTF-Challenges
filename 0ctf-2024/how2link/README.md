Play with libbfd to build an object file that can be linked into a shell executable

Consideing doing the whole link process in libbfd at first. But I find it way too hard to complete in the 48-hours event for anyone without knowledge of libbfd. (I'm also new to libbfd and took a few time to learn.) So I introduced ld to give a simplified version.
